* This is a complex topic that help in solving more and more complex problems
? Why
! no dynamic programming without the recursion
! no traversal without this
! no binary tree without this 
? Points to remember
! must need a base case and a recursive case
! you can convert the recursion into iteration and vice-versa
! since using the iteration is harder for complex problems we ar using recursion but the iterative solution always tends to prove more detailed way
! it will take more space than iteration due to the function calls
! Helps in breaking down bigger problems into smaller problems
? Easy way to get use of recursion
! use the recursion tree to visualize it
